Here is a README file for your GitHub project based on the uploaded dataset and code:
# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System
## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** that utilizes machine learning techniques to suggest the best crop based on soil and environmental conditions. The dataset contains essential agricultural parameters such as **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, **temperature**, **humidity**, **pH**, and **rainfall** to determine the most suitable crop.
## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset includes **2200 entries** with the following features:
- **N (Nitrogen)**
- **P (Phosphorus)**
- **K (Potassium)**
- **Temperature** (°C)
- **Humidity** (%)
- **pH** (Soil acidity/alkalinity)
- **Rainfall** (mm)
- **Crop label** (Target variable)
The dataset covers **22 different crop types**, including:
- 🌾 Rice
- 🌽 Maize
- 🍊 Orange
- 🍌 Banana
- ☕ Coffee
- 🌴 Coconut
- 🥭 Mango
- 🍇 Grapes, etc.
## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn```
## 📊 Data Analysis
The dataset has been analyzed using **histograms**, **scatter plots**, **box plots**, and **heatmaps** to explore the distribution of features, correlations, and outliers.
## 🚀 Features Implemented
- **Data Preprocessing**: Checking for missing values, duplicates, and encoding categorical labels.
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps for better understanding.
- **Feature Correlation**: Understanding relationships between soil nutrients and crop yield.
## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Implement a **machine learning model** for crop prediction.
- Deploy a **web-based interface** for farmers.
- Integrate **real-time weather data** for dynamic recommendations.
